            <h2>Different Bicep Parts</h2>

            <p>
                The Bicep muscle group is made up of two main muscles, the long and short head. The long head is responsible for raising the peak or arch of bicep muscle when flexing, and the short head is resposible for the overall size of your arm. Technically speaking, there are smaller muscles as well, however, they can be trained by by focusing on training these two. Most people over complicate the bicep training, and end up doing too much volume by attempting to incorporate multiple different movements. The two movements below are pretty much the only movements that are needed to build an impressive set of biceps.

            <h3>Long Head Training: Hammer Curl</h3>

            <p>
                Performing a hammer curl is very easy. Simply grab a pair of dumbels as if you are going to curl it as normal. However, instead of having your palms facing up, have them facing to the side. Do this for about two to three intense working sets.

            <h3>Short Head Training: Preacher Curl</h3>
            <img src="images/Dumbbell-Preacher-Curl.gif" alt="preacher-curl">
            <p>
                Performing a preacher curl requires some initial set up. If your gym/training area does not have a preacher curl machine, grab a normal bench that you can change the incline of, and set it to an incline of about 60-70 degrees. Then, grab one of your dumbells, rest the working arm on the bench, and perform a curl. Make sure that your tricep is making contact with the bench through the entirety of the movement. Do this for about two to three intense working sets.

            <p>
                *IMPORTANT* When performing this excercise, make sure you do not use a weight that you cannot control. It is very easy to snap a bicep when lowering the weight, especially towards the end of the set when the repititions are becoming increasingly more difficult.
