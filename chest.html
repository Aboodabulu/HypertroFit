                The pectoral muscle in made up of mainly two parts, the Clavicular head (upper chest) and the Sternal head (middle and lower chest). In many diagrams, you might see that the chest is split up into three separate heads (upper, middle, and lower). However, for the sake of training the muscle, we can merge the middle and lower heads together.

            <h3>Clavicular Head (upper chest) Training: Incline Chest Press</h3>

            <p>
                Training the upper chest is extremely simple. A basic incline chest press is all you need for two to three intense working sets. To set up this excercise, make sure you set your bench to an incline of around 30-45 degrees, and you can use a barbell, dumbells, or a machine designated for this excercise.

            <p>
                Training your middle and lowerr chest is also extremely simple. A basic flat chest press is all you need for two to three intense working sets. The set up this excercise, follow the same exact steps for the incline chest press and it can be done with a barbell, dumbells, or a machine designated for this excercise. The only different is to set up the bench to be parallel to the ground.

                *IMPORTANT*
                When executing these excercises, DO NOT have your arms too flared out by your sides. This can lead to shoulder injury in the longer run. Instead, bring your elbows in closer to your sides. Not only will this prevent shoulder injury, but having a 45 degree angle between your arm and the side of your body is the optimal position to activate the most amount of chest motor units. *SEE IMAGE BELOW*
