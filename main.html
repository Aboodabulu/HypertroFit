            Hypertrophy training is a specific type of training that focuses primarily on increasing the size of the human skeletal muscles. The goal of hypertrophy is to stimulate as much muscle growth as possible, often for aesthetic purposes, but it also contributes to overall strength and fitness. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Hypertrophy training is popular among bodybuilders, fitness enthusiasts, athletes, and fitness influencers. This specific type of training is not just about lifting weights; it also includes understanding on how to train smartly, eat correctly, and give you body time to recover for future training sessions. While the main goal of hypertrophy training is to increase overall lean muscle mass, it also offers benefits like improved metabolism, increased bone density, and enhanced physical strength and endurance.

        <h2>Hypertrophy Training Basics</h2>
        <p>
            There are several factors that fall under hypertrophy training that can be utilized to maximize muscle growth over time. These include:
            <ul>
                <li>Training Volume
                </li>
                <li>
                    Training To Failure
                </li>
                <li>
                    Tempo and Time Under Tension (TUT)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Progress Overload
                </li>
                <li>
                    Rest Periods
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

            <h3>Training Volume</h3>
            <p>
                Training volume can vary depending on muscle group, training frequency, and training intensity. A good rule of thumb is to train each muscle group for a total of 8-12 sets PER WEAK. Ideally, this should be spread out to where each muscle is trained twice in a given weak, and doing 4-6 sets for that muscle group in a given session. Some muscles respond better when trained in higher/lower volume, however, that is dependent on each person and their given body. 
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Training To Failure</h3>
            <p>
                Training to or close to failure is one of the main ways we can stimulate muscle growth. Especially if done with high enough intensity, training to failure will help recruit more motor units (muscle fibers), meaning that there is a greater amount of muscle mass that is being stimulated to grow. 
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Tempo and Time Under Tension</h3>
            <p>
                To understand time under tension and tempo, you must first understand the two actions of every muscle, the eccentric and concentric actions. The eccentric action is the stretching phase of an excercise while the concetric action is the contracting phase of an excercise. When doing a bicep curl, we stretch our bicep by lowering the weight (eccentric), and we contract (concentric) our bicep when we lift the weight towards our shoulder. The same goes for a chest press. We stretch out peck muscle when lowering (eccentric) the weight towards out chest, and we contract (concentric) when we push the weight off of our chest.
            </p>
            <p>
                Given this information, by slowing down and controlling the eccentric of a movement, we deeply and safely stretch the muscle, increasing total mechanical load and therefore recruiting more motor units. During the concentric, focus on exploding with the weight, pushing/pulling as hard as possible to complete the repitition of the excerise while maintaining form. This means applying more force against the weight, which requires the recruitment of yet more motor units, and that means more stimulus for growth.
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Progressive Overload</h3>
            <p>
                To ensure long term progression, slowly add weight or repitions to your working sets every weak or every session to your excercises. Remember, your body does not know how much weight is on the bar or machine you are using. All it knows is how difficult and how much work it has to put in to lift that weight. By increasing the weight or repitions on a consistent basis, your workouts should stay challenging relative to you.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Resting Periods</h3>
            <p>
                To ensure intensity remains high for each set, your body needs enough time to recover between each working set in order to perform on the next one. At the least, you should be resting around two minutes between each set. Ideally, a three to five minute resting window is most optimal.
