            Hypertrophy training is a specific type of training that focuses primarily on increasing the size of the human skeletal muscles. The goal of hypertrophy is to stimulate as much muscle growth as possible, often for aesthetic purposes, but it also contributes to overall strength and fitness.

        <p>
            Hypertrophy training is popular among bodybuilders, fitness enthusiasts, athletes, and fitness influencers. This specific type of training is not just about lifting weights; it also includes understanding on how to train smartly, eat correctly, and give you body time to recover for future training sessions. While the main goal of hypertrophy training is to increase overall lean muscle mass, it also offers benefits like improved metabolism, increased bone density, and enhanced physical strength and endurance.

        <h2>Hypertrophy Training Basics</h2>
        <p>
            There are several factors that fall under hypertrophy training that can be utilized to maximize muscle growth over time. These include:
            <ul>
                <li>Training Volume: This includes the number of sets done per muscle group and the number of repitions done per set. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Temp and Time Under Tension (TUT): This refers to the amount of time that is spent with the muscle being under mechanical load (weighted stress).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Lastly and most importantly for long term muscle growth is progressive overload.

        <h3>Training Volume</h3>
        <p>
            Training volume can vary depending on muscle group, training frequency, and training intensity. A good rule of thumb is to train each muscle group for a total of 8-12 sets PER WEAK. Ideally, this should be spread out to where each muscle is trained twice in a given weak, and doing 4-6 sets for that muscle group in a given session. Some muscles respond better when trained in higher/lower volume, however, that is dependent on each person and their given body. Lastly, if you are going to train low volume, the intensity of each set must increase and vice versa.
